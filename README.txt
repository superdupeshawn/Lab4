WELCOME TO SEVEN, ELEVEN, OR DOUBLES.

You play against the computer to reach a score of 10.
To play all you have to do is wait for you turn and type
the word, "Roll", and press enter when prompted. Don't
worry about case it will correctly assign it for you. The two
dice will roll and you will either have to get the dice to equal
a sum of 7 or eleven to get 1 point. To get 2 points you can roll
two of the same number for a double. HAVE FUN!
